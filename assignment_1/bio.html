	<p class="title1">Jeffrey Bortman: The Autobiography</p>
	<p class="title2">By Jeffrey Bortman</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">I, Jeffrey Michael Bortman, was born to Scott and Elaine Bortman at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital on September 22, 1994. I was raised in Natick, Massachusetts, and attended Natick Public Schools for kindergarten through the fifth grade. Those years molded the competitive side of my personality. Every Friday after school, my friend group met up at a local field for weekly installations of &quotFriday Football&quot. It was a full contact competition that was not only a constructive outlet for the pre/newly-pubescent boys, but also served as a vehicle to build the social dynamic. Being an early sprouter, I excelled in Friday Football, and learned that the other boys respected the kid who competed more than they respected the kid who would rather crack jokes from the sideline.  From this I learned to always compete whether it is on the field or in the classroom.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">What my Natick friends did not know, however, was that my parents had decided many years earlier that private school was a better fit for me in the long run. I was eventually accepted to Milton Academy, my parent&#39s first choice in school, for enrollment in the sixth grade. I say eventually because I had been rejected from Milton for the fourth and fifth grade enrollment cycles. Maybe I threw the interviews for the first two application years, who knows, but I knew I didn&#39t want to move schools and to start forging all new relationships.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Milton Academy was tough. On the first day of sixth grade we were given a &quotknowledge test&quot where we were asked to carefully read the instructions before starting the exam. The teacher also told us that we were being timed and that our times would be recorded. The first question was &quotwho was the 14th President of the United States?&quot At that moment I knew I was out of my league. Kids were finishing the 10 question test in under a minute and there I sat with no idea who the 14th President was. As it turns out the instructions said &quotdo not take this test, hand it in blank.&quot</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">That first day of Milton taught me a lot. First, always read instructions. Second, I never wanted to feel like I didn&#39t know what I should again. I knew that I wasn&#39t the kid with a photographic memory for whom academics &quotjust came easy,&quot and I quickly figured out that hard work and willpower were the only ways to be successful in the rigorous Milton curriculum. (I am currently riding the high of five months of continuous MCAT study, but, in part, it was my work ethic that got me there). </p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">The Milton struggle was made exponentially easier with a lot of support from my family. Grammy Phyllis and Papa Howie, my mom&#39s parents who live ten minutes from our house in Natick, always provided motivation in the form of what I like to call &quotJewish grandparent unconditional love.&quot This is the type of love that any time a grandchild successfully completed a meal without choking, the entire extended family was notified via a blast email. Grandma Joanie, my dad&#39s mom who lives in Connecticut, always stressed the importance of fun, which constantly reminded me about the importance of maintaining a balance between work and fun.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Perhaps my largest supporters, however, are my parents, who got divorced in 2012. Throughout the entire process, they were able to put aside their differences to make sure that my sister and I had an easy transition. My dad moved ten minutes away into the apartments in the Natick Mall, and we were free to come and go from his apartment as we pleased. Their handling of the divorce was a true testament to their altruistic parenting philosophy over the years. I always kept in mind how my parents put my sister and me before themselves, and I did my best to make them proud so that they could feel like their efforts were well worth it.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">My support system was most evident this year after being cut from the Tufts football team. After two years on the team and a pre-season roster of 105 men that would have to be cut to 75 by the first game, I was told that I was not one of the 75 most talented guys on the team. Being told that you aren&#39t good enough is always a tough pill to swallow, but it was made much easier by the classic Jewish Grandparent blast email titled &quotYay, our Jeffrey will no longer get repeatedly hit in the head.&quot</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">After football,  I now had time to focus on my medical-related personal interests, which was how I became involved with Tufts Emergency Medical Services (TEMS). I was pretty sure that I wanted to be a doctor before joining TEMS. My Dad is a cardiologist and I always found the anatomy class dissections more interesting than disgusting, but every time I was asked why I wanted to be a doctor I never had a concrete reason other than the cookie cutter response &quotbecause I like to help people.&quot I tried to argue that my sheer interest should be reason enough, but my Dad challenged me by saying &quotthe pursuit of medicine is not just a hobby you think you enjoy, it has to be a passion that will bring you joy for the rest of your life.&quot</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">TEMS helped me confirm my passion. One day, and without going into too much detail, I was able to help care for a suicidal young female who felt like &quotnobody cared for her.&quot This individual had tried to end her life, for which we were able to stabilize her and get her safely into the care of paramedics. Once stabilized, I was able to reassure her that there are many people out there who care for her, including us.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">After this call I realized that TEMS brought into my life everything that I learned and loved from kindergarten through college. TEMS incorporated skills I had learned on the football field such as fast improvisation and a never-quit attitude, as well as skills learned in the classroom such as hard work to study and maintain current protocols and procedures to provide the best patient care possible. TEMS further demonstrated the importance of my family support system, especially after a potentially taxing call like the one detailed above, and the importance of empathy not only in the field, but in everyday life. While I know that TEMS does not reflect the medical profession exactly, I know that I have a passion for it, and I am now willing to say for certain that I am prepared to turn that passion into a profession for the rest of my life.</p>
